# Dotfiles

This is my [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) setup. I've put it up here to make it easier for moving from machine to machine. You may find bits useful and are free to use it as you need.

## Assumptions

- This configuration assumes you have [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) installed, however you can easily remove/comment these lines.
- It replaces `cat` with [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- It replaces `ping` with [`prettyping`](https://github.com/denilsonsa/prettyping)
